The package includes the data used in Figures 1 to 5 in the paper. 
Since the raw data of the ionosonde is quite large and difficult to upload, the echo data of the Es layer after high-resolution imaging processing is packed together and uploaded here. 
All data can be imported and viewed directly by MATLAB with the function of "imagesc". 
Due to internal delay, the actual range should be obtained by subtracting five bins.
